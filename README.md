# 🏪 Shree Om Enterprises - Where It All Started, felt like Tony Stark. Grateful for my Lappy.

> *My first website. Made in Notepad. For my fathers's store. In 9th grade.*

##  Remember That Feeling?

You know that moment when you type `<html>` for the first time and suddenly feel like you can build the internet? That was me. 9th grade. Old computer. Blank Notepad screen. A dream to help my father's mobile phone shop.

No VS Code. No autocomplete. No "let me Google that." Just:
- A HTML textbook I borrowed from the library
- Notepad (yes, just Notepad)
- My dad's store that deserved a website
- Pure determination (and a lot of trial and error)

Every `<marquee>` tag that scrolled. Every `bgcolor` that changed colors. Every table that (finally) aligned properly. They weren't just code. They were **proof I could create something real**.

##  What This Is

**Year:** 2019-2020  
**Grade:** 9th Standard  
**Tools:** Notepad, a textbook, and a dream  
**Result:** A working website that made my dad proud 💚

## ✨ The Features (I Was So Proud Of)

###  The Scrolling Products
Used `<marquee>` (yes, I know it's deprecated now, but it was MAGIC back then!)
```html  
```
Watching those product images scroll felt like I'd built Amazon.

###  Google Maps Embed
###  Color Scheme
- `#023047` - Deep blue (looked professional to 9th grade me)
- `#7dcfb6` - Mint green (because it was calming)
- `#00b2ca` - Cyan (for that pop!)
- `#6c8dfa` - Purple-blue for the sidebar (aesthetic!)

---

##  The "Tech Stack" (Humble Beginnings)

**What I Used:**
- HTML (learned from a textbook, line by line)
- `<table>` for layout (this was 2019, I didn't know better!)
- `<marquee>` for animations (deprecated but ICONIC)
- `<font>` tags (yes, I used those)
- `bgcolor` attributes

---

## 🍷The Journey (The Real Story)

First line of code ever written:
```html

```
Felt like Tony Stark.

**The reveal:**
Showed it to my father. He didn't understand how it worked. But he understood it was **his store, online, made by his daughter**. That was enough.

---

## What I Actually Learned

### Technical Stuff
- ✅ HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- ✅ All the basic tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<a>`)
- ✅ Tables for layout (not best practice but hey, it worked!)
- ✅ Forms and all input types
- ✅ iframes (for that Google Maps embed)
- ✅ How to organize files and folders
- ✅ That `<marquee>` is deprecated (learned this later, still love it)

---

## Why This Matters (To Me)

This isn't the best website. The code isn't clean. It's not responsive. It breaks on mobile. The colors are... intense. There's no JavaScript. The layout uses tables.

**But it's mine.**

It's proof that:
- You don't need fancy tools to start
- You don't need to know everything before you begin
- Real projects teach you more than tutorials
- Creating something for someone you love hits different
- Starting messy is better than not starting at all
-

##  Where This Led Me

**From this 9th grade Notepad project, I went on to:**

- Learn proper CSS (external stylesheets are AMAZING)
- Discover JavaScript
- Build Android apps (Kotlin is now my friend)
- Study AI/ML (current journey)
- Create multiple web projects (with actual frameworks!)
- Understand responsive design (mobile-first is the way)
- Write clean, maintainable code (still learning, always will be)

But none of it would've happened without this first messy, colorful, marquee-filled website.

## To My Father

Thank you for:
- Trusting a 9th grader to build a website for your business

This website didn't bring thousands of customers. But it gave your daughter **confidence** that she can build something. And that changed everything.

---

## 🍁For Anyone Reading This

If you're a beginner thinking "I could never build something":

**STOP.**

I started with:
- Zero coding knowledge
- Just Notepad
- No computer science background
- No one to teach me
- Just a textbook 
---

## 🦩Final Thoughts

Years from now, I'll look at this and smile. Not because it's perfect (it's not). Not because it's impressive (it's really not). But because it represents:

**The moment I realized I could create.**

That 9th grade girl who opened Notepad and typed `<html>` had no idea where this would lead. But she had **courage**. And that was enough.

To everyone starting their journey: You don't need to know everything. You just need to start. Start small. Start messy. Start with passion.

The rest will follow.

*(And accidentally, the motto of my coding journey too)*

**P.S.** - If you find bugs in this code... congratulations, you found a time capsule of my 9th grade understanding of HTML.

**P.P.S.** - Yes, the colors are intense. Yes, there are too many `<marquee>` tags. Yes, inline CSS everywhere. That's the aesthetic. Embrace it.
