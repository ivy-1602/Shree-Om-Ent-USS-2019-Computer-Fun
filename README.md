# 🏪 Shree Om Enterprises - Where It All Started. Grateful for my Lappy.

> *My first website. Made in Notepad. In 9th grade.*

##  Remember That Feeling?

You know that moment when you type `<html>` for the first time and suddenly feel like you can build the internet? That was me. 9th grade. My lappy. Blank Notepad screen.
No VS Code. No autocomplete. No "let me Google that." Just:
- A HTML textbook I borrowed from the library
- Notepad
Every `<marquee>` tag that scrolled. Every `bgcolor` that changed colors. Every table that (finally) aligned properly. They weren't just code. They were **proof I could create something real**.

---

##  What This Is

**Shree Om Enterprises** is my father's mobile phone and accessories store in Pune. This website is:

-  My **first ever** web project
-  Made **entirely in Notepad** (no IDE, just me, my lappy and a textbook)
-  Built for a **real business** (my father's!)
-  Designed with **9th grade enthusiasm** (bright colors, marquees, maximum vibes)

**Year:** 2019-2020  
**Grade:** 9th Standard  
**Tools:** Notepad, a textbook, and a dream

## ✨ The Features (I Was So Proud Of)

###  The Scrolling Products
Used `<marquee>` (yes, I know it's deprecated now, but it was MAGIC back then!)
```html
<marquee>
```
Watching those product images scroll felt like I'd built Amazon.

###  Google Maps Embed
###  Color Scheme
- `#023047` - Deep blue (looked professional to 9th grade me)
- `#7dcfb6` - Mint green (because it was calming)
- `#00b2ca` - Cyan (for that pop!)
- `#6c8dfa` - Purple-blue for the sidebar (aesthetic!)

---

##  The "Tech Stack" (Humble Beginnings)

**What I Used:**
- HTML (learned from a textbook, line by line)
- `<table>` for layout (this was 2019, I didn't know better!)
- `<marquee>` for animations (deprecated but ICONIC)
- `<font>` tags ( i used to forget to close tags sometimes)
- `bgcolor` attributes

---

## 🍷The Journey (The Real Story)

First line of code ever written:
```html
<!Doctype html>
```
Felt like Tony Stark.

---

## What I Actually Learned

### Technical Stuff
- HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- All the basic tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<a>`)
- Tables for layout (not best practice but hey, it worked!)
- Forms and all input types
- iframes (for that Google Maps embed)
- How to organize files and folders
- That `<marquee>` is deprecated (learned this later, still love it)

---

## Why This Matters (To Me)

This isn't the best website. The code isn't clean. It's not responsive. The colors are... intense. There's no JavaScript. The layout uses tables.

**But it's mine.**

It's proof that:
- You don't need fancy tools to start
- You don't need to know everything before you begin
- Real projects teach you more than tutorials
- Creating something for someone you love hits different
- Starting messy is better than not starting at all
---

##  Where This Led Me

**From this 9th grade Notepad project, I went on to:**

- Learn proper CSS (external stylesheets are AMAZING)
- Discover JavaScript
- Build Android apps (Kotlin is now my friend)
- Study AI/ML (current journey)
- Create multiple web projects (with actual frameworks!)
- Understand responsive design (mobile-first is the way)
- Write clean, maintainable code (still learning, always will be)

But none of it would've happened without this first messy, colorful, marquee-filled website.

I started with:
- Zero coding knowledge
- Just Notepad
- No computer science background
- No one to teach me
- Just a textbook

*Made with 🤍, Lappy's Notepad, and a 9th grader's determination*

*"YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING YOU WANT" - Shree Om Enterprises*

*(And accidentally, the motto for my life as well.)*

**P.S.** - If you find bugs in this code... congratulations, you found a time capsule of my 9th grade understanding of HTML.

**P.P.S.** - Yes, the colors are intense. Yes, there are too many `<marquee>` tags. Yes, inline CSS everywhere. That's the aesthetic. Embrace it.
